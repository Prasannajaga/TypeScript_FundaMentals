# Moral of the Story 

when life goes well like javascript there's no fun to live. So that is precisely the Typescript comes in and 
makes some fun. TS was like I want problems always 

```js
let data = 'Happy Coding ....';
data = 10  // where JavaScripts accept everything
```

```ts
let data : string = 'Happy Coding ....';
data = 10 //Hey you can't do like this is not allowed 
```

We can't accept everything. At Some Point, we need some guidance to get through life and restriction is a must when you
want to improve yourself. Indeed TypeScript lover here!!! let's have some fun around with Strictly Type Checking Language.
